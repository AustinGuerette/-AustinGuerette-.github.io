  <h1>Why FreshBrew Café Exists</h1>

  <p>Millions of people start their day feeling rushed and disconnected, grabbing whatever caffeine they can just to survive the morning. But too often, they end up with bland, corporate coffee that lacks heart—and a space that lacks community. The morning ritual, once something calming or meaningful, has become just another task in a busy day.</p>

  <p>FreshBrew Café exists to change that. We promise not just better coffee, but a better start. Our beans are ethically sourced, roasted locally, and served in cozy, community-first spaces. Whether you're on your way to work or just need a place to reset, we’re here to make your day feel like *yours* again—one cup at a time.</p>
